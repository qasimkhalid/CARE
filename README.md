# A Small Office Floor Scenario with 10 People 
Here a small office floor was taken as an example for this use case consisting of two offices, two open halls, an entrance, an exit, and a washing closet. It is shown in Figure 1. Each entity, such as space, floor exit, and fire extinguisher, was represented using Smart Building Evacuation Ontology (SBEO). Also, specific attributes of spaces were expressed, such as accommodation capacity, connections with other spaces, and the distance between the connected spaces (e.g., cost of each connection between two nodes), as shown in Figure 2.

## How to Run the Simulation:

1. Clone the project by selecting any of the options, e.g., Downloading zip, cloning it using git.  
2. Once, the project is cloned, please, go to the [**CAREE.java**](https://github.com/qasimkhalid/CAREE/blob/Scenario_OfficeFloor_10People/src/main/java/CAREE.java) file that can be found in *src/main/java/* directory .
3. Run the file.
