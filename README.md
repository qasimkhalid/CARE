# A Shopping Mall scenario with 100 people 
Here we considered a shopping mall featuring over 31 stores, 2 rest areas, 4 restaurants, 1 cafe, 2 washing closets, 3 fire safety equipment places, and 4 exits (3 emergency exits and one general entrance that may be used as an exit. It is shown in figure below. 
Each entity, such as space, floor exit, and fire extinguisher, was represented using Smart Building Evacuation Ontology (SBEO). Also, specific attributes of spaces, such as accommodation capacity, connections with other spaces, and the distance between the connected spaces (e.g., cost of an edge between two nodes), were expressed.

An extra layer of sensors (diamond symbol) and new virtual connections, such as junctions, is also added to the floor plan, as shown in Figure 2.* |

## How to Run the Simulation:

1. Clone the project by selecting any of the options, e.g., Downloading zip, cloning it using git.  
2. Once, the project is cloned, please, go to the [**CAREE.java**](https://github.com/qasimkhalid/CAREE/blob/Scenario_ShoppingMall_100People/src/main/java/CAREE.java) file that can be found in *src/main/java/* directory .
3. Run the file.
